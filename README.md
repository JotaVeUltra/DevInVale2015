# DevInVale2015
Project for DevInVale2015 Presentation

The sounds are long taken and modified from opengamearts.org. As I don't remerber the links, I won't put here.

I'll change them ASAP to sonds with proper licenses/copyrights.

The images were all made by me with Inkscape.

To run the game install the requirements, then run the game.py file

Thanks!
